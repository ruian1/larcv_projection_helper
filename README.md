# larcv_projection_helper
helper functions for making projections using LArCV


LArCV applied the x-y coordinates from OpeCV where the top left point is set as the origin point. This is different from LArTPC origin point. Here are some utilily functions to do projections from 3D LArTPC coordinates to 2D LArCV corordinates.
